# Advanced Reinforcement Learning Assignment

## Overview:
The following files are essential to build and design your reinforcement learning algorithm.

- [common.py](common.py) with constants
- [util.py](util.py) with utility functions
- [game.py](game.py) with graphic display related calls
- [environment.py](environment.py) features behavioural aspects of the scenario
- [agent.py](agent.py) includes components for training like environment interaction and previous state
- [link.py](link.py) holds skeleton of methods for you to develop (This is the only file you're allowed to modify)

We have also got a illustrative GIF to better explain the scenario.

## How to Execute:

On enabling the `--debug` flag, verbose output of training and GUI's Q(s, a) colouring can be visualised. The GUI execution can alternate between standard and debug modes via SPACE key
